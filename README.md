- Visual Studio development
- closed source software unavailable on Linux (audio workstations, photoshop, ...)
- for hardware with drivers that don't work well on Linux (digital piano, ...)

Some dependencies are only available as HTML content
Some dependencies are only available as HTML content. The dependencies in `lib` are fallbacks if the manual download and parse function doesn't work.
